# Contributing to Mangle

## We are glad that you are interested in contributing...

The Mangle project team welcomes contributions from the community. We are always thrilled to receive [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request), and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

Please familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vmware/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

CLA: Before you start working with {{ project }}, please read and sign our Contributor License Agreement [CLA](https://cla.vmware.com/cla/1/preview). If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our contributor license agreement (CLA), our bot will prompt you to do so when you open a Pull Request. For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ]([https://cla.vmware.com/faq](https://cla.vmware.com/faq)).

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a [Github issue](https://github.com/vmware/mangle/issues) or discuss it first with the official project maintainers via [team chat](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa0fe7cfcd9bc451b8a5b1fc60302cc8e%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=34804802-7ffb-4f9a-8e7a-95b9c7ce305a&tenantId=b39138ca-3cee-4b4a-a4d6-cd83d9dd62f0), especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

## Ways to contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions and not all of them need a Pull request. Contributions may include:

* New features and proposals
* Documentation
* Bug fixes
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions and giving feedback
* Helping to onboard new contributors
* Other related activities

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work
- Make commits of logical units
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below)
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
- Submit a pull request

Example:

``` shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmware/mangle.git
git checkout -b my-new-feature master
git commit -a
git push origin my-new-feature
```

### Staying In Sync With Upstream

When your branch gets out of sync with the vmware/master branch, use the following to update:

``` shell
git checkout my-new-feature
git fetch -a
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

### Updating pull requests

If your PR needs changes based on code review, you'll most likely want to squash these changes into
existing commits.

If your pull request contains a single commit or your changes are related to the most recent commit, you can simply
amend the commit.

``` shell
git add .
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

If you need to squash changes into an earlier commit, you can use:

``` shell
git add .
git commit --fixup <commit>
git rebase -i --autosquash master
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

Be sure to add a comment to the PR indicating your new changes are ready to review, as GitHub does not generate a
notification when you git push.

### Code Style

### Formatting Commit Messages

We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message.  See
[GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues
and commits.

## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

When opening a new issue through [Github](https://github.com/vmware/mangle/issues), try to roughly follow the commit message format conventions above.
